# Basic Arithmetic Compiler using LLVM 


The project involves designing and implementing a simple arithmetic compiler that accepts arithmetic expressions as input and generates LLVM IR code. The compiler should be able to handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as parentheses for grouping expressions.
